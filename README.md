# Amazon-Fire-TV-WASK-web-app
I'll post supportive ideas and code for the Fire TV WASK builds here.
I'm looking for methods that would allow for (2 or more purposes)
A main thrust will be to make an AD SERVER compatible with the WASK build, this may mean redesigning the OVP in order to insert VIDEO ADVERTS as pre-roll, midroll, etc. VIA any method such as VAST/VPAID and others like Adpods.
If ads cannot be incorporated into an Amazon Web TV app, than it's an important goal to find a way to redirect an existing WASK built Fire TV channel to a different free Fire TV channel that I own.  (The idea being that the "different" channel would be an Android-based channel that uses adverts to monetize the app.)
Developers may post here or private-message me at the Facebook profile DeanLach
